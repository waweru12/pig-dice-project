# PIG DICE GAME

# Author: Austin waweru
# Description

A web application that generates a number randomly and returns it with specific instructions. For instance if person one rolls a dice it will show the random number from 1 to 6 but if you are unfortunate and get a 1 you are awarded a 0 and the chance given to the second player.

# Rules

    -The rules are simple. Two players will compete. The first player to reach 100 points or more is the winner

    -When it is your turn, you roll. If you get a Pig-Out or an Oinker/one, then you pass the pigs onto the next player.

    -If you get anything else, you may decide to roll again or pass the pigs.

    -If you keep rolling again, you accumulate points to add to your bank but if you get a Pig-Out, then all your points accumulated this turn are nullified.
